                        <ul style="padding:100px">
                                <li><p><b>Collaborative:</b><br>Technology is a key tool to promote and enhance collaboration skills. Learning to work with
                                     others is a life skill that will stand to every student in the future. Technology makes collaboration and 
                                     teamwork easy. There are a host of platforms teachers can use to utilise collaboration as a main component
                                      of learning in class or at home. Jigsaw learning, collaborative writing and task-based projects are all 
                                      some of the activities that can be done using technology</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>communication skills:</b><br>Having good communication skills in the workplace is all about being able to
                                     convey information to people clearly and simply, in a way that means things are understood and get done.
                                      It’s about transmitting and receiving messages clearly, and being able to read your audience. It means 
                                      you can do things like give and understand instructions, learn new things, make requests, ask questions
                                       and convey information with ease.

                                    </p></li>
                                <li> <p><b>Problem solver:</b><br>Broadly defined, problem solving is the process of finding solutions to difficult or 
                                    complex issues. But you already knew that. Understanding problem solving frameworks, however, requires 
                                    a deeper dive.
                                    Think about a recent problem you faced. Maybe it was an interpersonal issue. Or it could have been a major
                                     creative challenge you needed to solve for a client at work</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Attention to detail</b><br>
                                    We all know that attention to detail is important because it helps prevent mistakes and makes success in the
                                     workplace easier. The problem is that being attentive to detail can be nearly impossible when you’re at 
                                     work and your boss and colleagues keep distracting you, or you’re one of those people who just can’t focus.
                                      But, there are methods and techniques which you can apply that will help you become better at paying
                                       attention to detail.
                                    </p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Strong organizational skills:</b><br>If you have ever had to search through endless stacks of business papers
                                     to find the one document that you need, you know the value of being organized. It saves time and helps keep 
                                     a business humming along smoothly day to day and over the long term. "Good organizational skills" encompasses
                                      physical and mental organization and time management abilities. Good organizational skills are essential for
                                       successful business owners who need to balance a host of different duties.</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Ability to multi-task and prioritize:</b><br>Unless you’re managing just one or two people, it’s inevitable
                                     that you will be involved with many issues and tasks all at once.  Some need immediate attention, while 
                                     others are less important.  Multitasking is about knowing how to juggle several issues or tasks at once.
                                     Prioritizing is about knowing which of the issues or tasks are the most important and need to get done first.
                                     You need to be able to combine multitasking and prioritizing expertly.  This is a bit of an art, but
                                      it can be learned.</p></li>
